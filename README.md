# compiler

A compiler for Wilsey's compiler class. The course site can be found [here](http://www.ece.uc.edu/~paw/classes/eecs6083/),
and the language specification can be found [here](./projectLanguage.pdf).

TODO: Document each major component of the compiler, including design docs and any implementation notes. Furthermore,
add documentation explaining how to run the tests with the simple test harness.
