A compiler for Wilsey's compiler class. The course site can be found [here](http://www.ece.uc.edu/~paw/classes/eecs6083/),
and the language specification can be found [here](./projectLanguage.pdf).

# Lexer

The first step in the compilation phase is performing *lexical analysis* or *scanning*.
Some useful documentation from Wilsey's site is as follows:
